# Ports & Adapters

Decide which ports and adapters you want to distinguish in this application.

For every port, add a directory to the already existing `Infrastructure` directory.

For every adapter, add a directory to the corresponding port directory.

Same as hexagonal architecture (with 6 ports)

example
port: UserInterface
adapter: Web
