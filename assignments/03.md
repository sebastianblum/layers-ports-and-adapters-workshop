# Input adapters

For the *UserInterface* port we want *Web* and *Cli* adapters which don't duplicate application or domain logic. 
Introduce a service that handles the "Schedule meetup" use case, which can be invoked by both the `ScheduleMeetupController` and the `ScheduleMeetupConsoleHandler`.

Next, apply the [Introduce Parameter Object](http://refactoring.com/catalog/introduceParameterObject.html) to the service call.

You'll end up with something that's known as a *command* and a *command handler*.

## Hints

- While you're at it, create a directory for each port (`UserInterface`, `Persistence`) inside the already existing `Infrastructure` directory. Then inside each port directory, create a directory for each port adapter. Move the code that's currently in `Infrastructure` to the right subdirectory/namespace. 
- You may leave out the part where the form data gets validated. We'll fix this in the next assignment.
