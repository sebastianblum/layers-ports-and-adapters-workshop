# Output adapters

There's one output adapter, the one which persists our domain objects. The *persistence* adapter currently consists of just the `MeetupRepositoryFilesystem`.

To make sure our command handler doesn't violate the *Dependency Rule*, we have to apply the *Dependency Inversion Principle* to it.

Apply the [Extract Interface](http://refactoring.com/catalog/extractInterface.html) refactoring and fix the dependency injection configuration in `app/container.php`.
