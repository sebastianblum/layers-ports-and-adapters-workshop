# Different types of tests

Make a proper division in `test/` based on the types of tests this project has, i.e. 

- system tests,
- acceptance tests, 
- integration tests, 
- and unit tests.

## Hints:

- You can define multiple PHPUnit test suites in `phpunit.xml.dist`.
- You can use different namespaces under `Tests` to mark the difference between types of tests.

## Hinweise

- Unit Tests: 1 Klasse, no IO (no db, no filesystem), no Setup (no sqlite, ...), mocking only dependencies "you own"
- Integration Tests - Testing for adapters: maybe multiple classes, including IO, some Setup, mocking no dependencies (infrastructure)
- Acceptance Tests - testing your application services: multiple classes, use cases, infrastructure stand-ins (application layer)
- System Tests - testing your application end-to-end (smoke tests): the real deal
